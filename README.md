Getting Started:
    Responces go in responces.py, the format is easy...
    Maybe read the slack python APIs?
        https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient
        https://api.slack.com/rtm
        https://api.slack.com/events-api

TODO:
    Try Excepts on everything.  Too sleepy for that now...
    Comments
    OAth...
    Add more responces
    virtualenv
    base word counts off steps from BotName rather then position in message to allow for mid message bot useage
    Fix parse mode setting so @smrtz and @movrcx won't get flagged in the about message.  Currently, it just uses their github....

TODO Tomorrow:
    Test getUserToken and getUserName with both 'smrtz' and '@smrtz'
    Test fireAway with and without channel
